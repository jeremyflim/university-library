# University Library Project (Modified)

This is a slightly modified version of the [University Library JSM](https://github.com/adrianhajdin/university-library-jsm/tree/main) project. I followed along with the original tutorial by Adrian Hajdin and made a couple of key enhancements:

- **Functional Profile Page:** Users now have access to a functional profile page showing their borrowed books.
- **Onboarding Emails via Node Mailer:** Instead of using Resend, this version uses Node Mailer. This means you donâ€™t need your own domain to send onboarding emails, which I did not have access to. For my own deployed version, I used GMail.

The project is deployed on Vercel and is designed to be simple to set up, extend, and deploy.
## Tech Stack

- Next.js
- PostgreSQL
- Upstash
- ImageKit
